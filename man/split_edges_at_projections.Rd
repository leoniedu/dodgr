\title{Split graph edges at projection points}
\usage{
split_edges_at_projections(
  graph,
  xy,
  dist_tol = 1e-06,
  dist_min = dist_tol,
  debug = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A dodgr street network data frame.}

\item{xy}{A two-column matrix or data frame of coordinates (x, y).}

\item{dist_tol}{Numeric; minimum distance between split points (default 1e-6).}

\item{dist_min}{Numeric; minimum distance from existing vertices to create splits (default dist_tol).}

\item{debug}{Logical; if TRUE, print debug output.}
}
\value{
Modified graph with edges split at projection points.
}
\description{
This function finds the closest projection points from supplied coordinates to graph edges
and splits those edges at the projection points. Projection points that coincide with
existing graph vertices are not created as new split points.
